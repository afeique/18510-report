% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already

% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


\usepackage[justification=centering]{caption}
%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} accurate transduction of sound into an electrical signal is naturally useful for conveying the human voice. People generally speak at 40~to~60~dB~SPL and can hear sound from 20~Hz~up~to~20~kHz with especial sensitivity to the 1~to~4~kHz region.\supercite{smith} For the application of accurate sound reproduction, the designer should strive for unity-gain response in these ranges, particularly in the 1~to~4~kHz range.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{OktavaMK319vsShureSM58.png}
  \caption{\em Oktava~MK-319 condenser microphone~\supercite{oktava} and Shure~SM58 dynamic microphone\supercite{shure} (20~Hz to 20~kHz)}
	\label{fig:OktavaMK319vsShureSM58}
\end{figure}

A variety of devices exist for transducing sound. Of commercially viable designs, condenser and dynamic microphones are the most common.~\supercite{shambro} Fig.~\ref{fig:OktavaMK319vsShureSM58} plots the responses of a condenser microphone and a dynamic microphone. The condenser mic (in red) experiences less attenuation at the extremes and provides greater uniformity in between. It is not unusual for condenser mics to have an upper 20~kHz frequency limit compared to the typical 16~kHz limit experienced by dynamic mics.~\supercite{white} Additionally, the condenser microphone has notably less gain in the 1~to~4~kHz region people are most sensitive to, providing a more balanced response. Generalizing these results, condenser microphones are preferable for applications desiring accurate reproduction.

% marker
% Operation of a condenser microphone necessitates a high DC bias voltage with low noise and ripple. This makes condenser microphones less portable and more expensive on the whole than if this had not been the case. Electret condenser microphones (ECMs) overcome this issue by using an electret-foil material  that has its own quasi-permanent charge.

\end{figure}

The diaphragm portion of the condenser microphone has a cylindrical form-factor. Its cross-section is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:DiaphragmSystem}. The diaphragm itself is a thin, tensioned membrane which is responsive to sound pressure in the target frequency range. The back-plate is a rigid structure with distributed perforations leading to an internal cavity. Between the membrane and the back-plate is the air-gap which forms the condenser dielectric. An acoustic resistance at the rear of the internal cavity serves as a normalizing vent, allowing the cavity to equalize to atmospheric pressure $P_0$.

Condenser microphones convert sound pressure into a change in capacitance by the process shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SignalChain}. Sound pressure gives rise to a pressure gradient which causes deflection across the condenser diaphragm. Membrane deflection in turn  causes the capacitance of the condenser to vary. %Variations in capacitance produce corresponding changes in voltage on the interface circuit the condenser is coupled to. %The resultant AC small-signal can then be extracted from the circuit and fed through a preamplifier to obtain a low output impedance voltage signal representing the source sound.

\subsection{Membrane Deflection}

Assuming that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item membrane residual stress $\sigma_{M,0}=0$
	\item pressure $\Delta p$ is uniform across the membrane
	\item the membrane's movement is purely along the $z$-axis
\end{enumerate}

The apex deflection $w_0$ can be found using Eq.~\ref{eq:Apex}.\supercite{schomburg} 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Paraboloid.png}
	\caption{\em Membrane deflection modeled as a circular paraboloid}
	\label{fig:Paraboloid}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		w(r) = w_0\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R_M^2}\right)
		\label{eq:Deflection}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta p = \frac{4w_0 d_m}{R_M^2} \frac{E_M}{1-v_M^2} \left( \frac{4}{3} \frac{d_M^2}{R_M^2} + \sigma_0 + \frac{64}{105} \frac{w_0^2}{R_M^2} \right)
		\label{eq:Apex}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Deflection Due to Bias Voltage}

Keeping the membrane at $z=0$, let the back-plate be held a distance $h$ away from the membrane at $z=h$ to create the dielectric air-gap. Applying a DC bias voltage $V_b$ between the membrane and back-plate causes opposing surface charges to form on the plates. By Coulomb's law, these surface charges attract and produce an electrostatic force $F_v$ on the membrane described by Eq.~\ref{eq:ElectrostaticForce}.\supercite{aip} This force varies with the radius and is greater closer to the apex of deflection at $r=0$. Simplifying the force to be uniform across the membrane allows it to be described in Eq.~\ref{eq:ElectrostaticPressure} as a uniform pressure $\Delta p_v$.\supercite{aip}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		F_v = \frac{1}{2}V^2\frac{\epsilon_0\pi R_M^2}{(h-w_v)^2}
		\label{eq:ElectrostaticForce}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		\Delta p_v = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\left(\frac{V_b}{h}\right)^2
		\label{eq:ElectrostaticPressure}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Capacitance}

When only the bias voltage $V_b$ is applied, Eq.~\ref{eq:VoltageApex} relates how the pressure due to voltage $\Delta p_v$ produces an apex deflection $w_{v,0}$ towards the back-plate.\supercite{aip} Letting $w_0=w_{v,0}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:Deflection} yields Eq.~\ref{eq:VoltageDeflection}, an expression $w_v(r)$ for the deflection due to the bias voltage at any radius $r$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		w_{v,0} = \frac{\Delta p_v R_M^2}{4T}
		\label{eq:VoltageApex}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
		w_v(r) = w_{v,0}\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R_M^2}\right)
		\label{eq:VoltageDeflection}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}

The modeled deflection $w_v(r)$ can be used to calculate the total condenser capacitance using the differential relationship shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:DifferentialCapacitance}. The differential relationship models the condenser as a collection of parallel-plate capacitors having capacitance $dC$ and area $dA=r\,dr\,d\theta$. Integrating over the area of the membrane yields the expression for capacitance shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:Capacitance}. Using Eq.~\ref{eq:SeriesLn} to formulate a second-order ($n=2$) series approximation for $\mathrm{ln}(x)$, the logarithm in Eq.~\ref{eq:Capacitance} can be approximated to Eq.~\ref{eq:SeriesCapacitance}.\supercite{aip} The value $C_0$ denotes the capacitance when there is no membrane deflection due to sound, $w_0=0$.


\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		dC = \frac{\epsilon_0\,dA}{h-w_v} = \frac{\epsilon_0\,r\,dr\,d\theta}{h-w_{v,0}}
		\label{eq:DifferentialCapacitance}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		C = \frac{\epsilon_0\pi R_M^2}{w_{v,0}} \mathrm{ln}\left|\frac{h}{h-w_{v,0}}\right|
		\label{eq:Capacitance}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		\mathrm{ln}(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}(x-1)^n
		\label{eq:SeriesLn}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		C = \frac{\epsilon_0\pi R_M^2}{h-w_v} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{w_v}{h-w_v} \right)
		\label{eq:SeriesCapacitance}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}

\section{Interface Circuit}

The interface circuit is the portion of the design responsible for converting variations in capacitance across the condenser into a low impedance voltage signal. It does so in two steps, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SignalChain}. First the AC small-signal is extracted to obtain a high output impedance voltage signal using the coupling circuit in Fig.~\ref{fig:CouplingCircuit}. This signal is then transformed into a low output impedance voltage signal using a preamplifier. The final signal can be sent much longer distances without noticeable degradation.\supercite{bruel}

Fig.~\ref{fig:SmallSig} represents the small-signal equivalent model of Fig.~\ref{fig:CouplingCircuit}. The interface circuit is inherently non-linear, so analyzing its small-signal equivalent model is an effective method of linearizing the relationship between capacitance and output voltage. In the small-signal equivalent model:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The DC-blocking coupling capacitor $C_b$ is shorted; 
	\item The polarizing DC-only voltage source $V_b$ is shorted;
	\item The condenser's varying capacitance $\Delta C$ itself is modeled as a small-signal current source $i_c$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{smallSig.png}
	\caption{\em Small-signal equivalent model of interface circuit}
	\label{fig:SmallSig}
\end{figure}

Note that when the polarizing voltage $V_b$ is shorted in the small-signal model, current-limiting resistor $R_B$ is now in parallel with the other devices in the interface circuit, particularly because coupling capacitor $C_B$ is modeled as a short in the small-signal model. Thus, since all elements are in parallel, no additional analysis – Miller approximations, for example – will be necessary. The result is a simplified Norton circuit with small-signal source seen in eq.\ref{eq:SmallCurr} and impedance seen in Eq.\ref{eq:Impedance} 

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		i_c = (j \omega \Delta C) V_b
		\label{eq:SmallCurr}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		Z_eq(s) = Z_R || Z_C = \left(\frac{R}{1 + sCR}\right)
		\label{eq:Impedance}
	\end{equation}

\end{figure}

where

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		Z_R = R_b || R_i
		\label{eq:ImpedanceR}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		Z_C = C_0 + C_i
		\label{eq:ImpedanceC}
	\end{equation}

\end{figure}

By Ohm's Law and principles of source transformation, we derive the voltage output $v_o$, represented by Eq.\ref{eq:outputV}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		y =
		\label{eq:outputV}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		Z_C = C_0 + C_i
		\label{eq:ImpedanceC}
	\end{equation}

\end{figure}



\section{Sensor Characteristics}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering	
	\begin{tabular}{ c | l | l }
		\hline
		\bf Symbol & \bf Description & \bf Typ. Value \\
		\hline
		$\sigma_M$ & surface mass density & $4.45 \times 10^{-2} \; \mathrm{kg/m^2}$ \\
		$T$ & room temperature & 300 K \\
		$k_B$ & Boltzmann constant & $1.38 \times 10^{-23} \; \mathrm{J/K}$ \\
		$R_A$ & damping resistance & $2 \times 10^7 \mathrm{N \cdot s/m^5}$ \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\caption{\em Symbols used in analyzing sensor characteristics}
	\label{fig:CharSymbols}
\end{figure}

Unless otherwise noted, the equations presented in the following section are derived using \emph{AIP Handbook of Condenser Microphones}, see Ref. \cite{aip}. The electrical transfer function of the biased condenser when there is no deflection due to sound is given by Eq. \ref{eq:ElecTransferFunc}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		M_e = \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_b}{h-w_0} \cdot \left[ 1 + \frac{C_i}{C_0} \right]^{-1}
		\label{eq:ElecTransferFunc}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sensitivity}

The sensitivity of the microphone is given by Eq. \ref{eq:Sensitivity} where $T$ represents the membrane tension.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		M_p = M_e \cdot \frac{R_M^2}{8T}
		\label{eq:Sensitivity}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}

Based on Eq. \ref{ElecTransferFunc} and Eq. \ref{eq:Sensitivity}, it is evident that the membrane radius can greatly affect the microphone sensitivity. This can be affirmed by the observation that larger diaphragm microphones have greater sensitivity than smaller ones. Intuitively, increasing membrane tension decreases the sensitivity of the sensor by limiting the movement of the membrane.

\subsection{Dynamic Range}

The Maxim MAX4466 is the chosen amplifier for this design. Its datasheet indicates it has a 200 kHz operating bandwidth. In contrast, the condenser's operating bandwidth has an upper-limit around the vacuum resonant frequency of the membrane. This is given by Eq. \ref{eq:FreqResponse} where $\sigma_M$ is the surface mass density of the diaphragm membrane.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		f_H = \frac{2.4048}{2\pi R_M} \left( \frac{T}{\sigma_M} \right)^{1/2}
		\label{eq:FreqResponse}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}

It is clear from Eq. \ref{eq:FreqResponse} that a larger bandwidth can be attained with higher tension, smaller membrane radius, and a thinner membrane with a lower surface mass density. Many condenser microphones, including the Oktava MK-319 in Fig. \ref{OktavaMK319vsShureSM58} have a mechanical resonant peak around 10 kHz.

\subsection{Sensitivity to Temperature}

Within the diaphragm system, thermal expansion of the diaphragm membrane due to an increase in temperature causes a reduction in membrane tension $T$. By Eq. \ref{eq:Sensitivity}, this behavior increases the sensitivity but decreases the bandwidth. An increase in temperature additionally produces a corresponding increase in air viscosity. This physical feature of air is important primarily around the mechanical resonant frequency as it causes higher damping which in turn results in a lower and broader resonant peak. 

Temperature increases also affect air density and subsequently the mechanical-acoustic properties of the diaphragm system, namely the acoustic compliances.

The composite result of the above temperature effects is a low sensitivity to temperature, typically on the order of $-0.005 \; \mathrm{dB/K}$.

The amplifier datasheet shows the op-amp performance across a range of temperatures. As the implicit use for the microphone presented in this article is around room temperature, focus is given to the temperature range of 293K to 300K. Within this region, the op-amp's temperature dependency is quite linear. The most notable impact of temperature is its effect on large-signal gain which decreases by approximately $-0.35 \; \mathrm{dB/K}$ in this region.

\subsection{Noise Analysis}

Johnson noise has a power spectral density (PSD) according to the Nyquist formula shown in Eq. \ref{eq:PSD} where $T$ is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. The pressure spectral density (pSD) is simply the square-root of the PSD. Results from Eq. \ref{eq:PSD} can be used to calculate the RMS noise pressure experienced by the microphone. Calculations are given with $\Delta f = 10 \; \mathrm{kHz}$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		PSD = (pSD)^2 = \frac{p_{rms}^2}{\Delta f} = 4 k_B T R_A \; \mathrm{[Pa^2/Hz]}
		\label{eq:PSD}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{split}
		PSD &= 4 \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 300 \times 2 \times 10^7 = 3.3 \times 10^{-13} \; \mathrm{Pa^2\,Hz}
		\\ pSD &= \sqrt{3.3 \times 10^{-13}} = 5.74 \times 10^{-7} \; \mathrm{Pa\,Hz^{1/2}}
		\\ p_{rms} = 5.75 \times 10^{-7} \times \sqrt{10^4} = 5.75 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{Pa}
	\end{split}
\end{figure}

% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
