%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already

% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


\usepackage[justification=centering]{caption}
%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} accurate transduction of sound into an electrical signal is naturally useful for conveying the human voice. People generally speak at 40~to~60~dB~SPL and can hear sound from 20~Hz~up~to~20~kHz with especial sensitivity to the 1~to~4~kHz region.\supercite{smith} For the application of accurate sound reproduction, the designer should strive for unity-gain response in these ranges, particularly in the 1~to~4~kHz range.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{OktavaMK319vsShureSM58.png}

	\label{fig:OktavaMK319vsShureSM58}
\end{figure}

A variety of devices exist for transducing sound. Of commercially viable designs, condenser and dynamic microphones are the most common.~\supercite{shambro} Fig.~\ref{fig:OktavaMK319vsShureSM58} plots the responses of a condenser microphone and a dynamic microphone. The condenser mic (in red) experiences less attenuation at the extremes and provides greater uniformity in between. It is not unusual for condenser mics to have an upper 20~kHz frequency limit compared to the typical 16~kHz limit experienced by dynamic mics.~\supercite{white} Additionally, the condenser microphone has notably less gain in the 1~to~4~kHz region people are most sensitive to, providing a more balanced response. Generalizing these results, condenser microphones are preferable for applications desiring accurate reproduction.

The diaphragm portion of the condenser microphone has a cylindrical form-factor. Its cross-section is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:DiaphragmSystem}. The diaphragm itself is a thin, tensioned membrane which is responsive to sound pressure in the target frequency range. The back-plate is a rigid structure with distributed perforations leading to an internal cavity. Between the membrane and the back-plate is the air-gap which forms the condenser dielectric. An acoustic resistance at the rear of the internal cavity serves as a normalizing vent, allowing the cavity to equalize to atmospheric pressure $P_0$.

Condenser microphones convert sound pressure into a change in capacitance by the process shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SignalChain}. Sound pressure gives rise to a pressure gradient which causes deflection across the condenser diaphragm. Membrane deflection in turn  causes the capacitance of the condenser to vary. %Variations in capacitance produce corresponding changes in voltage on the interface circuit the condenser is coupled to. %The resultant AC small-signal can then be extracted from the circuit and fed through a preamplifier to obtain a low output impedance voltage signal representing the source sound.

\subsection{Membrane Deflection Due to Impinging Sound Pressure}

Assuming that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item membrane residual stress $\sigma_{M,0}=0$
	\item pressure $\Delta p$ is uniform across the membrane
	\item the membrane's movement is purely along the $z$-axis
\end{enumerate}

The apex deflection $w_0$ can be found using Eq.~\ref{eq:Apex}.\supercite{schomburg} By approximating the three dimensional deflection as a paraboloid, we can derive the expression shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:Deflection} which describes the deflection at any radius $r$ in cylindrical coordinates.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		w(r) = w_0\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R_M^2}\right)
		\label{eq:Deflection}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta p = \frac{4w_0 d_m}{R_M^2} \frac{E_M}{1-v_M^2} \left( \frac{4}{3} \frac{d_M^2}{R_M^2} + \sigma_0 + \frac{64}{105} \frac{w_0^2}{R_M^2} \right)
		\label{eq:Apex}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Deflection Due to Bias Voltage}

Keeping the membrane at $z=0$, let the back-plate be held a distance $h$ away from the membrane at $z=h$ to create the dielectric air-gap. Applying a DC bias voltage $V_b$ across the condenser causes opposite charges to form on the plate. By Coulomb's law, these charges attract and produce an electrostatic force $F_v$ on the membrane described by Eq.~\ref{eq:ElectrostaticForce}.\supercite{aip} This force varies with the distance to the back-plate at a particular radius and is greater closer to the apex of deflection at $r=0$. For simplification we assume the force to be uniform across the membrane.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		F_v = \frac{1}{2}V^2\frac{\epsilon_0\pi R_M^2}{(h-w_v)^2}
		\label{eq:ElectrostaticForce}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}

Because we model the electrostatic force as being uniform across the membrane, we describe it in Eq.~\ref{eq:ElectrostaticPressure}\supercite{aip} as a uniform pressure $\Delta p_v$. This value can be used in conjunction with Eq.~\ref{eq:Apex} to calculate the apex deflection caused by the bias voltage, $w_{v,0}$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta p_v = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\left(\frac{V_b}{h}\right)^2
		\label{eq:ElectrostaticPressure}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Capacitance}

When only the bias voltage $V_b$ is applied, the membrane has an apex deflection $w_{v,0}$ towards the back-plate along the positive $z$-axis. Using Eq.~\ref{eq:Deflection} and letting $w_0=w_{v,0}$ yields Eq.~\ref{eq:VoltageDeflection} which models the deflection caused by the bias voltage. This modeled deflection $w_v(r)$ can be used to calculate the total condenser capacitance by using the differential relationship shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:DifferentialCapacitance}. This differential relationship models the condenser as a collection of parallel-plate capacitors having capacitance $dC$ and area $dA=r\,dr\,d\theta$. By integrating over the area of the membrane, we get the expression for capacitance shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:Capacitance}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{equation}
		w_v(r) = w_{v,0}\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R_M^2}\right)
		\label{eq:VoltageDeflection}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
		dC = \frac{\epsilon_0\,dA}{h-w_v} = \frac{\epsilon_0\,r\,dr\,d\theta}{h-w_v}
		\label{eq:DifferentialCapacitance}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		C = \frac{\epsilon_0\pi R_M^2}{w_v} \mathrm{ln}\left|\frac{h}{h-w_v}\right|
		\label{eq:Capacitance}
	\end{equation}
\end{figure}



\section{Interface Circuit}

The interface circuit is the portion of the design responsible for converting variations in capacitance across the condenser into a low impedance voltage signal. It does so in two steps, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SignalChain}. First the AC small-signal is extracted to obtain a high output impedance voltage signal using the coupling circuit in Fig.~\ref{fig:CouplingCircuit}. This signal is then transformed into a low output impedance voltage signal using a preamplifier. The final signal can be sent much longer distances without noticeable degradation.\supercite{bruel}

Fig.~\ref{fig:SmallSig} represents the small-signal equivalent model of Fig.~\ref{fig:CouplingCircuit}. The interface circuit is inherently non-linear, so analyzing its small-signal equivalent model is an effective method of linearizing the relationship between capacitance and output voltage. In the small-signal equivalent model:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The DC-blocking coupling capacitor $C_b$ is shorted; 
	\item The polarizing DC-only voltage source $V_b$ is shorted;
	\item The condenser's varying capacitance $\Delta C$ itself is modeled as a small-signal current source $i_c$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{smallSig.png}
	\caption{\em Small-signal equivalent model of interface circuit}
	\label{fig:SmallSig}
\end{figure}

Note that when the polarizing voltage $V_b$ is shorted in the small-signal model, current-limiting resistor $R_b$ is now in parallel with the other devices in the interface circuit, particularly because coupling capacitor $C_B$ is modeled as a short in the small-signal model. Thus, since all elements are in parallel, no additional analysis (Miller approximations, for example) will be necessary. The result is a simplified Norton circuit with small-signal source seen in Eq. \ref{eq:SmallCurr} and impedance seen in Eq. \ref{eq:Impedance}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		i_c = (j \omega \Delta C) V_b
		\label{eq:SmallCurr}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		Z_{eq}(s) = Z_{R_{eq}} || Z_{C_{eq}} = \left(\frac{R_{eq}}{1 + sR_{eq}C_{eq}}\right)
		\label{eq:Impedance}
	\end{equation}

\end{figure}

where

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		R_{eq} = R_b || R_i
		\label{eq:ImpedanceR}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		C_{eq} = C_0 + C_i
		\label{eq:ImpedanceC}
	\end{equation}

\end{figure}

By Ohm's Law and principles of source transformation, we derive the voltage output $v_o$, represented by Eq.\ref{eq:outputV}. The frequency-independent voltage at the output, then, is simply the magnitude of this.  

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		v_o(s) = i_c(Z_{eq}(s)) = \frac{\Delta C}{C_{eq}} V_b \frac{sR_{eq}C_{eq}}{1 + sR_{eq}C_{eq}}
		\label{eq:outputV}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		v_O = \frac{\Delta C}{C_{eq}} V_b = \frac{\Delta C}{C_0} \left(1 + \frac{C_i}{C_0}\right ) V_b
		\label{eq:outputFI}
	\end{equation}

\end{figure}

We must also consider the frequency response, as the most important bands of interest must be present at the output. In Eq.~\ref{eq:cutoff}, we determine a low-frequency cutoff.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R_{eq}C_{eq}}
		\label{eq:cutoff}
	\end{equation}

\end{figure}

It's necessary to cascade this circuit into a pre-amplifier. Rather than for gain, this stage is primarily for impedance matching purposes. The following diagram exhibits a pre-amplifier that, for our purposes, is built from the MAX4466 operational amplifier. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.24]{Amplifier2.png}
	\caption{\em Amplifier stage (seen on the right)}
	\label{fig:Amplifier}
\end{figure}

Note that in this configuration, $R_i$ in our small-signal model is encapsulated by the $1 M\Omega$ self-biasing resistors in parallel, since the DC-only power source is shorted in a small-signal analysis. These self-biasing resistors are large to match impedance with the very large input resistance at the op-amp pins. We also assume that $C_i = 0$. The current-limiting resistor $R_b$ is realized with the two $2 k\Omega$ resistors and coupling capacitor $C_b$ is realized with the $0.01 \mu F$ DC-blocking capacitor. 

It's clear that the voltage at the inverting pin can be expressed as a division of admittances. Here we have a non-inverting operational amplifier configuration with a potential divider network between $Z_{-}$ and $Z_{f}$. The transfer in signal can be expressed with Eq. \ref{eq:transFunc}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		V_{-} = V_{out} \frac{G_{f}}{G_{-} + G_{f}}
		\label{eq:invertingPin}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
		G_{-} = (Z_{-})^{-1} = \frac{sC_{-}}{1 + sR_{-}C_{-}} 
		\label{eq:Gminus}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		G_{f} = (Z_{f})^{-1} = sC_{f} + \frac{1}{R_{f}}
		\label{eq:Gf}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
		A_{v} = 1 + \frac{Z_{f}}{Z_{-}}
		\label{eq:transFunc}
	\end{equation}
	
\end{figure}

Thus, the low-frequency (DC) closed-loop gain $A_{CL}$ using $R_{f} = 100 k\Omega$ and $R_{-} = 10 k\Omega$ is simply 11:

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		A_{CL} = 1 + \frac{R_{f}}{R_{-}} = 11
		\label{eq:lfGain}
	\end{equation}
	
\end{figure}

It's commonly accepted to assume the output impedance of a non-inverting operational amplifier configuration is very low, and sometimes approximated as 0$\Omega$. From a more analytical approach, we can derive an expression for the exact output impedance, as seen in Eq. \ref{eq:outZ}. Note that, for the Max4465, the open-loop gain is typically $A_{VOL} = 95 dB = 56,000 V/V$. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\begin{equation}
		R_{out} = R_{0} \frac{A_{CL}}{A_{VOL}}
		\label{eq:outZ}
	\end{equation}
	
\end{figure}

$R_{0}$ is an internal resistance intrinsic to the amplifier, and note that $A_{VOL}$ greatly exceeds $A_{CL}$, yielding an output impedance that is low and can drive a range from $17 \Omega$ to $300 \Omega$ with acceptable power transfer. 

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables

%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\

%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.



\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
